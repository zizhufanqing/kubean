# Contributing

Welcome to Kubean!

## Requirements

The source code of Kubean is written in [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) and managed with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To easily install Kubean, you may need to have [helm](https://helm.sh/) installed.

## Getting involved

Please check [issues](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues) to see if there are any existing tasks you may be interested in.

In particular, if you're just getting started, you may want to look for issues labeled with [kind/feature](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Ffeature) or [kind/bug](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fbug), which are standard labels in the cloud-native communities.

Besides, Kubean is based on [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray), so you may need to learn little about Kubespray first.

If you're interested in working on any of these, please leave a comment to let us know!

> Note:
>
> Please open an issue or discussion before starting work on a new feature or large change.

## What's next

If you're planning to contribute code changes, the reviewers may need you to:

- follow [good coding guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue.

If you're looking to contribute documentation improvements, you'll want to read the [documentation](https://kubean-io.github.io/website).
